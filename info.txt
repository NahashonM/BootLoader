Hello Again...!

Our bootloader will be a 3 stage loader.
A BootA which loads a BootB
	both these live on numbered blocks and should be static
	from relocation
BootC is loaded by BootB and resides on a filing system
	relocatable


partition table:
	1. MBR
		a. 2 TB limit
		b. 4 partions
		c. 
	2. GPT
		- Doesnt suffer any of the above

in using GPT disk structure

[ BootLoader | protective mbr partition ]   [    GPT HEADER   ]
  446 bytes		  64 bytes + magicnum
		1st Sector (512 bytes)					 2nd sector
		
		
In MBR just have the BootLoader and mbr partition within the 512 bytes
The Code in MBR is not enough to load a kernel loader
So just tuck the stage 2 safely in the gap btwn MBR and first defined
	partition
The Bpb will help you locate the other stages.

In GPT we dont have this..
But we can define a Bios Boot Partition for us
This will hold our stage 2 loader
This BBP should never be touched as long as our DDD exists
Real sectors can then start from here
The BPB will still be here
